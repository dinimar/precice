## How to work with this template

* [ ] assign a release manager, who takes care of the process
* [ ] assign each point below to a responsible person, before you continue. Use `@member`.

Only the release manager should update this post (even tickboxes, due to race conditions in editing). Everybody else should comment on the PR with the progress.

## Step by step guide
* [ ] Merge master to develop (No commits after the release on master)
* [ ] Create branch `release-N` from develop. If needed, `git rebase develop`.
* [ ] Open PR from `release-N` to `master` (use [this template](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/add_PR_template/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/release_pull_request_template.md))
* [ ] Look over [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md) (all)
   * Add things, if necessary
   * Extract summary
* [ ] Look over the Roadmap and update entries.
* [ ] Do regression tests using the release branch (specific revision) _list below :arrow_down:_ (all)
* [ ] Bump version in:
   * [ ] [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md)
   * [ ] [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/CMakeLists.txt)
   * [ ] (do independent release, if necessary!) [Python bindings](https://github.com/precice/python-bindings)
   * [ ] (do independent release, if necessary!) [MATLAB bindings](https://github.com/precice/matlab-bindings)
* [ ] Draft message to mailing list
* [ ] Update documentation (all)
  * [ ] Update markdown configuration reference in wiki
* [ ] Fix potential problems in develop (all)
* [ ] Approve the PR with at least two reviews (all)
* [ ] Merge PR to master 
* [ ] Tag release (on GitHub, make sure to select the release branch as target) and merge back to develop
